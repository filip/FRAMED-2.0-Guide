FRAMED Artist Guide

# 0. Introduction

FRAMED offers a number of different ways to submit your artworks to the platform. From applications for Windows (.exe) to web pages, it has never been easier to share and collect digital art. 

This document is designed to inform you on the basic technical specifications for creating an artwork, as well as the flow of listing and selling your content via FRAMED. When creating and selling artwork on FRAMED, please make sure to read this guide carefully.

## Step 1. Artwork Development & Testing

Artist will be responsible for the actual development of the artwork. The artwork can be of any type and category, including but not limited to Video/Graphic/Interactive. When the artwork has been developed, please submit your files via the online upload feature on the FRAMED website. Our team will test your artwork on the actual device, and will report back if there are any issues with your artwork. Testing and reporting phase will continue until the artwork is optimized.

## Step 2. Artwork/Artist Information

When artwork testing/debug/optimization has been completed, your artwork will be submitted to the platform and you will receive a notification stating that your artwork is now available on FRAMED.

## Step 3. Artwork License Contract/Pricing & Editions

Before the artwork is listed and released to the public, the Artwork licensing contract will be signed. Also, price of the artwork and the number of release issues/editions will be determined. These details are set by the artist during the upload process.

## Step 4. Artwork Launch/Sale Begins

After all the information has been received and artwork has been tested, the artwork will be released to the public to begin sales on the FRAMED GALLERY. Updates will be released through the FRAMED Website and News Release. Artist will be able to check the current sales status through our website. As per the license contract, proceeds of the artwork sales will be distributed every three months.

## 1-1. FRAMED Summary

• FRAMED is based on Windows 8 OS. Any work playable on a Windows 8 PC with equal specifications listed below will be able to play on the FRAMED device.

• For FRAMED hardware specs, please review the following http://frm.fm/specification/.

• All artworks will be played as a Windows applications (.exe) file, and will be displayed at W1080*H1920 pixel in full screen.

• Artworks can also optionally include the use of webcam/mic that are embedded on the device.

• As the device will be always connected to the internet, artists are also free to use the web as an additional input source for the artwork.

• FRAMED also supports playback of artworks from the web but if you wish to  sell web based artworks you need to follow the official submission feature. 

## 1-2. Video/Still Artworks

For artists who work with the video/still/GIF image media, our system will package and release the submitted video/photo data into a playable application.

### ■ Resolution

The artwork will be displayed at W1080 * H1920 Full HD format. Any work created at a lower resolution will be stretched. FRAMED also supports landscape videos and this option is included during the upload.

### ■ Frame Rate

The highest frame rate is 30FPS.

### ■ Playback Format

The basic format for playing back the artwork is the “infinity loop.” However, there are other ways to program the artwork for different playback formats if they are packaged as applications (see guides for other frameworks below). For example:

• Randomly selecting sections
• Time/Clock based (content changes according to the time of day)
• Interactive playback (content changes according to environment, i.e. sound and/or human presence)

### ■ Submission of Artwork

• For video artwork, please submit the data as a Quicktime (.mov).
• Please encode in H.264, unless otherwise specified.
• If the artwork requires special or unique playback format, we may additionally request other versions such as uncompressed data.
